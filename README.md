A Java-based restaurant app for managing purchases, calculating totals, and printing receipts.

Building a Java-Based Restaurant App

I recently developed a Java-based Restaurant App that allows customers to purchase items, calculate the total, and print receipts. This project helped me strengthen my skills in Java, object-oriented programming, and receipt generation logic.

Key Features:
Item selection and purchase management
Automatic total calculation
Receipt generation and printing

Technologies Used:
Java (Core Java, OOP)
Console-based interface (or GUI if applicable)

How It Works:
The user selects food items to purchase.
The app calculates the total price.
A receipt is generated and displayed/printed.
